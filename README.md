# finance-ai-thing
A bank account transaction analytics dashboard thing that uses AI to give predictions about stuff.

i need something cool to put on my resum√©, and I also want to implement AI in one of my projects.

plans/things to learn and use:
- mongodb
- express.js
- use docker (and possibly kubernetes)
  - multiple services: web app, database, learning thing
- tensorflow or scikit-learn
- publish on heroku (or a personal server if i have the money for that)
